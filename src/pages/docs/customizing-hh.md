title: Customizing Hikma Health System
description: The Hikma Health platform is developed with customization in mind. From customizing the forms right from within the software, to more involved customizations involving changes to the code.

## The 2 ways to make customizations

There are two ways to customize different aspects of the Hikma Health platform. You can either make changes through the administrator portal, or make changes to the code.

### Customizing through the dashboard

Through the administrator dashboard you can create and manage your own custom forms for use by your team (typically clinicians, nurses and other healthcare workers).

This is the easier option of the two, requiring no technical expertise. You simply log in-to the administrator dashboard and either navigate to the "Patient Registration" section 
or the "Forms" section and update the forms to your liking.

Both types of forms should cover most customization needs, allowing you to change what data can be collected from the mobile app. It is also important to remember that the Hikma Health 
mobile application is offline-first, so users must "sync" their apps to load the new/updated forms ready for use next time.



### Customizing through the code

Through this approach, you can customize anything and everything - making this approach very powerful, time-consuming and requiring the most technical know-how. Depending on what you wish 
to customize you should be familiar with either Typescript, Python and PostgreSQL, as well as how to use community projects from those programming languages.

You can change the small things like the logos and color schemes, to the large things like adding new languages and data schemas. Our team is always happy to field requests around customizations.
