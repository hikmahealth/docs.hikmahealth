description: Create and manage forms from the administrators portal for all users to utilize

Through the Admin portal, users can create all the forms they need and have them available on the mobile applications for the beneficiaries.

## Event Forms

The term "Event" is used to describe any and all interactions between a patient and a care provider.

Examples of Events include:

- Patient symptoms
- Patient treatment plans
- Dental examination
- Lab testing & investigations
- ...

These forms can be created and customized by clinic administrators at any time for use by the care providers on the ground.

### Form Builder

The administrators portal has a built-in form builder that allows them to use a variety of input types for richer and more complete data collection. Below are the types of inputs that are collected defined by their type signatures

```typescript
export type FieldType =
  | 'binary'
  | 'medicine'
  | 'diagnosis'
  | 'dosage'
  | 'free-text'
  | 'input-group'
  | 'options'
  | 'date'
  | 'custom'

export type HHFieldBase = {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  required: boolean
}

export type FieldOption = {
  label: string
  value: string
}

export type BinaryField = HHFieldBase & {
  fieldType: 'binary'
  inputType: 'checkbox' | 'radio' | 'select'
  options: FieldOption[]
}

export type OptionsField = HHFieldBase & {
  fieldType: 'options'
  inputType: 'checkbox' | 'radio' | 'select'
  options: FieldOption[]
}

export type DiagnosisField = HHFieldBase & {
  fieldType: 'diagnosis'
  inputType: 'select'
  options: FieldOption[]
}

export type TextField = HHFieldBase &
  (
    | {
        fieldType: 'free-text'
        inputType: 'text' | 'number' | 'email' | 'password' | 'tel'
        length: 'short'
        units?: DoseUnit[] | DurationUnit[]
      }
    | {
        fieldType: 'free-text'
        inputType: 'textarea'
        length: 'long'
        units?: DoseUnit[] | DurationUnit[]
      }
  )

export type MedicineField = HHFieldBase & {
  fieldType: 'medicine'
  inputType: 'input-group'
  fields: {
    name: TextField
    route: MedicineRoute
    form: MedicineForm
    frequency: TextField
    intervals: TextField
    dose: TextField
    doseUnits: DoseUnit
    duration: TextField
    durationUnits: DurationUnit
  }
}

type MedicationEntry = {
  name: string
  route: MedicineRoute
  form: MedicineForm
  frequency: number
  intervals: number
  dose: number
  doseUnits: DoseUnit
  duration: number
  durationUnits: DurationUnit
}

export type DateField = HHFieldBase & {
  fieldType: 'date'
  inputType: 'date'
  min?: Date
  max?: Date
}

export type HHField =
  | BinaryField
  | TextField
  | MedicineField
  | DiagnosisField
  | DateField
  | OptionsField
```

The form generated is simply a collection of the above inputs and is stored in the database where the mobile apps can sync to.

### Form Renderer

The mobile app has a set of screens and components that interpret the JSON form data and render out a functioning form capable of recording and storing the information as a JSON blob in the metadata field

## Considerations

- As forms change and get updated, all data collected with the new forms will be slightly different from previous data

// TODOS:

[ ] üèÅ Document things to consider when updating the form

[ ] üèÅ TODO: Document how to customize the different input fields on mobile
