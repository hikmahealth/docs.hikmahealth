## Development Workflow

We follow a trunk-based development workflow where the `dev` branch serves as our main development branch:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine
2. **Create feature branches** from the `dev` branch (not `main`)
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear, descriptive messages
4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Submit pull requests** against the `dev` branch
6. **Code review** - wait for maintainer review and address feedback
7. **Merge** - once approved, your code will be merged into `dev`
8. **Release** - periodically, after thorough testing, `dev` is merged into `main` for production release

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code, stable releases only
- `dev` - Active development branch, all PRs should target this branch
- `feature/*` - Feature branches created from `dev`
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches created from `dev`

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 22.14 or higher
- pnpm (Fast, disk space efficient package manager)
- PostgreSQL (local or remote)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hikma-health-backend.git
   cd hikma-health-backend
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-health-backend.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section)

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   pnpm run migrate:latest
   ```

6. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout dev
git merge upstream/dev
```

---

## Running Tests

We use two testing frameworks:

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Run all unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (recommended during development):

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests require admin credentials to be set in your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

Run all E2E tests:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Run E2E tests with UI (helpful for debugging):

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

Run E2E tests in debug mode:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

### Before Submitting a PR

Ensure all tests pass:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Code Style and Quality

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting to maintain consistent code style across the project.

### Running Code Quality Checks

Check formatting and linting:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Format code:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Lint code:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation when changing functionality

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch from `dev`**

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull upstream dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow the code style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run quality checks**

   ```bash
   pnpm check
   pnpm test
   pnpm test:e2e
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

   - Go to the original repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select `dev` as the base branch
   - Select your feature branch as the compare branch
   - Fill out the PR template with:
     - Clear description of the changes
     - Motivation and context
     - Link to related issues
     - Screenshots (if applicable)
     - Checklist items completed

7. **Respond to feedback**

   - Address review comments promptly
   - Push additional commits to your branch as needed
   - Request re-review when ready

## Environment Variables

### Development Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database connection (required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/hikma_health

# Application environment (optional)
APP_ENV=dev

# Server URL (optional)
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Client-side variables (optional)
VITE_APP_TITLE=Hikma Health
```

### Testing Environment

For E2E tests, you'll need admin credentials:

```bash
# E2E Test Credentials (required for E2E tests)
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
VITE_ADMIN_PASS=your-test-password
```

### Sentry Configuration (Optional)

For error tracking and monitoring:

```bash
VITE_SENTRY_ORG=your-org
VITE_SENTRY_PROJECT=your-project
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Never share sensitive credentials in public forums or PRs
- Use different credentials for development and production
- Follow HIPAA and healthcare data protection regulations

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages for clarity and automated changelog generation:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci` - CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
feat(pharmacy): add medication inventory tracking
